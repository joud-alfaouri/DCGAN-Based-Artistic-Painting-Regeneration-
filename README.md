# DCGAN-Based Artistic Painting Regeneration  

A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) project aimed at regenerating paintings by merging human-created art and AI-generated images, showcasing the creative potential of artificial intelligence in the artistic domain.  

## Overview  
This project explores the fusion of human creativity and machine-generated art. Using DCGAN, the model regenerates paintings by learning from a dataset of traditional and AI-generated artwork, pushing the boundaries of artistic innovation.  

## Key Features  
- Combines human artistry with AI creativity to generate unique paintings.  
- Implements a DCGAN architecture tailored for artistic image regeneration.  
- Showcases the intersection of technology and art.  

## Sample Results
